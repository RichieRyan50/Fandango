# Fandango
Gov 1005 Final Project

Have you ever wondered if movie rating sites like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes differ drastically in there ratings?

This project takes data from Fandango via FiveThirtyEight and compares movie ratings from various popular sites. You can look at the correlation between scores among these sites. Through this analysis I have come to the conclusion that, although nearly all of the sites strongly correlate with one anotehr, Fandango's movie ratings do not strongly correlate with any of the other sites. This could be due to their scoring system or certian biases the site may hold, but further research is necessary to determine what makes Fandango different from the other sites.
